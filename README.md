# first-todolist
My first program that I wrote applying the basics of Python3 that I have learnt over the past couple of months. It's simple and I am proud that I got this working. I will continue building on this to make it more efficient and able to run more complicated prompts.
I used Visual Studio Code to input the codes and saved it to a '.py' file, and execute it on windows command prompt.
I tried utilizing as many functions as possible for a barebones approach, simplified and clean.
I would like to experiment more by running this through class functions if possible in the near future. I will continue building upon this.
